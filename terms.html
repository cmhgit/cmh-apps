  <div class="panel-body">

			<h4>Privacy</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy", "Privacy Policy") carefully before using the http://cmh-apps.com website and mobile applications (the "Service") developed by Chad Hughes ("us", "we", or "our"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Service, all websites, applications and products on which this Privacy Policy is shown or linked.
			</p>

	    		<h4>Personal Information</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
	  "Personal Information" is information that, either alone or in combination with other information collected, identifies an individual. When we combine other information (i.e., information that does not, on its own, identify an individual) with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.
The Service collects some personal information from its users, which we may use to operate the Service, to evaluate and enhance performance of the Service. We will not share any of your personal information with any third party, except we may share personal information with another company in the event that we merge with or are acquired by that company. We do not send promotional or marketing materials to our users.
			</p>

	    		<h4>When you Communicate with Us</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
			When you interact with us for support, we may collect Personal Information, such as your name, email address and contact preferences. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing service issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. We use this information to provide you with customer and Service support. We may analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys.
			</p>

			<h4>AgeTacular and Apple's iCloud</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
			If you choose to enable iCloud syncing (the iCloud syncing setting is left off by default), AgeTacular will copy your data, which may include Personal Information if you entered Personal Information into AgeTacular, from your device to your account in Apple's iCloud for the purpose of syncing your data between supported devices which use the same iCloud account. We do not have access to your iCloud account, your data in your iCloud account, your data in transit to your iCloud account, nor the data on your device.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="text-left">Export function: AgeTacular includes an export function which exports your AgeTacular data stored in your iCloud account to a standard json format.</li>
				<li class="text-left">Delete function: AgeTacular also includes a delete function which will delete your AgeTacular data stored in your iCloud account if you decide to remove AgeTacular data from your iCloud account and turn off iCloud syncing.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h4>Message Boards, Forums</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
			The Service may have links to third party message boards, forums, issue tracking, chat functionality, blogs, and similar features through which you can post information, messages and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services may become public information, and may be available to visitors to those sites and to the general public. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information, or any other information, to such services.
			</p>

			<h4>Notice to California Residents</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
		California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information, if any, we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request to us. It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes or for purposes of assisting us with our own marketing.
			</p>

			<h4>California Do Not Track Disclosures</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
		At this time, the Service does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals or other mechanisms that provide users with choice about the collection of their personal information over time and across third party web sites or online services. Additionally, the Service does not prevent third parties, such as our partners, from conducting online tracking on the Service.
			</p>

			<h4>Links, Third Party Apps, and Third Parties’ Privacy Practices</h4>
			<p class="text-left">
			The Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us, and may contain links to apps that you can download from third parties. These linked sites and apps are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any linked sites and apps. If you use any third-party sites or apps, any Personal Information collected by the third party’s site or app will be controlled by the privacy policy of that third party. We recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of any third parties to which you provide Personal Information.
			</p>

If you are aware of a user under the age of 13 using the Service, please contact us.
			</p>

			<h4>Policy Changes</h4>

			We have the discretion to update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage you to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the Personal Information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of modifications.
