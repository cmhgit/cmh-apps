---

- **Age Tracking:** Enables age calculation for tracking the ages of your children and loved ones, or the elapsed years, months and days since past events, all in one clean and simple view
- **Date Countdown:** Track future events with the years, months and days remaining
- **Elegantly Clean:** Just the years, months and days in a highly condensed, simplified format (e.g., 4y5m6d for 4 years, 5 months and 6 days), or quickly jump into the detail view for additional information
- **Saves:** Your birthdays and events are saved for future reference (not a one-time-use, date-to-date calculator)
- **iCloud Syncing:** Sync between any supported devices using the same iCloud account
- **Sorts:** Set sort preferences to sort by event age or by name, and to specify whether to reverse the sort logic
- **Shares:** Supports standard iOS share sheet functionality to quickly send information to any application that accepts text from a share sheet (e.g., messages, mail, notes, etc.)
- **Additional Detail:** Switch on the additional detail setting to tell the share sheet to share additional age and event detail, if desired, or leave the default setting to share a condensed level of detail with supporting apps
- **Copy and Paste:** The age in the detail view supports copy and paste as an alternative to using the share sheet functionality for a quick copy and paste into another app
- **Universal App:** AgeTacular is a universal app that runs on iPhone®, iPad® (with Split View support), and iPod touch® with just one purchase (and no in-app purchases)
- **No Ads!**
