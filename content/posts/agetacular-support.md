## FAQ

##### How do I start?
In the main view nav bar at the top, tap the + sign in the top right to add your first event.
Where are the settings?
In the main view, tap the icon that looks like a gear, or cogwheel, located to the left of the + sign at the top.

##### How do I share?
Tap the event that you want to share in the main view to go into the detail view. In the top right of the nav bar in the detail view, tap the share icon.

##### Delete events?
Need to delete an event? There are two ways:
  1. tap the "Edit" button in the top, left on the main screen, select the delete button on the left of any event you want to delete, then tap the "Done" button when finished, or
  1. slide left on any event to reveal a "Delete" button on the right, then tap it.

##### Event changes?
Need to change the name or date of an event? Two ways: 1) swipe left on the row you want to edit from within the main screen view, Edit and Delete buttons will appear, tap Edit, or 2) simply add a new event with any desired changes, go back to the main screen to verify the new details, then delete the original event with the old information.

##### Is today counted?
Yes, the end date of the date calculation (today) is counted, but the event date is not (e.g., yesterday's event would be calculated as 1 day, not 2 or 0 days).
