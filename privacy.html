Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any personal data third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal data third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request to us. It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes or for purposes of assisting us with our own marketing.
